class Board:
    """
    This class wraps the original data structure representing the board, which
    is a list of integers âˆˆ {0, 1, 2} representing either an empty cell (0),
    a piece from player 1 (1) or a piece from player 2 (2).

    The regular size of the board is 7 rows x 6 columns, but those values are
    parametrized, but won't change during the game.

    The following is a representation of a board with its row indexes, column
    indexes and board indexes
